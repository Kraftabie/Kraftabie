# Kraftabie

Welcome to the official **Kraftabie** datapack page! You can also view the official website at [kraftabie.github.io](https://kraftabie.github.io)! What does this datapack do you may ask? Created by [roc0ast3r](https://github.com/Roc0ast3r) on February 28, 2021, this mod adds recipes to items you cannot craft in Vanilla Minecraft, making every item in the game craftable!

Whether that would be eggs, Notch Apples, horse armor, every single item will be craftable!

For more information on how to install, and other useful information, please check the [wiki](https://github.com/Kraftabie/kraftabie-mod/wiki)!
